But will road traffic automation be a blessing or a curse for future sustainable mobility concepts? Technology Assessment  is confronted with a dilemma that is not untypical for this discipline: On the one hand, in view of the many uncertainties, possible implications of the new technology can so far only vaguely be described.

Based on TechnikRadar , a representative survey of the German population, the authors discuss the acceptability of nursing robots by the German public. The results of these analyses demonstrate that the perception of nursing robots depends on the context and the expected societal consequences of their use.

The models RIBA, Care-O-bot, Pepper and Paro were considered. The questionnaire was based on the Technology Usage Inventory. The results show that senior citizens do not reject nursing robots in hospitals in principle, but that acceptance and skepticism depend strongly on the application scenario. It was observed that the provision of information on care robots can arouse great curiosity among seniors regarding new technologies. The vast majority of senior citizens surveyed assume that nursing robots can relieve nursing staff physically and temporally.

Although this is a conservative hypothesis, it is considered for technical and social reasons.

Rather than charging for access, fees should be paid for publication. The article looks at potential risks to the open, unfettered publication of new scientific findings. Currently, three approaches are being pursued: charging research institutions a flat publication fee to remove the burden from authors, giving authors a choice between paid open access publication and free publication without open access, and having the fees paid by authors and reimbursed by their institutions \u2013 which may imperil open and unrestricted publication, an effect that must be empirically analyzed.","https:\/\/www.tatup.de\/index.php\/tatup\/article\/view\/33\/96":"he printing press played a major role in the emergence of an open science system. The Mertonian scientific norms reflect this openness. They also demonstrate, however, that science understands itself as a profession of certified experts. The openness of science was enabled by social closure. Open science challenges this social closure of scientific practice.","https:\/\/www.tatup.de\/index.php\/tatup\/article\/view\/34\/97":"Visions of technology, guiding visions, and future scenarios are imaginaries of far-reaching \u201csociotechnical futures\u201d that relate imagined technological developments to changes in society. They present particular analytical challenges to technology assessment , concerning both the assessment of the meanings and impacts of these imaginaries in innovation processes and the self-reflexive positioning of TA itself within the field of knowledge politics. Answering to the demands of the discussion paper on \u201cTechnology assessment of sociotechnical futures\u201d for a self-reflexive positioning of TA in the analyzed processes, a suggestion is made as to how TA\u2019s vision assessment can reflect upon its own role by understanding its own research, consulting and design of sociotechnical futures as socio-epistemic practices, positioning itself accordingly in the field of knowledge politics.","https:\/\/www.tatup.de\/index.php\/tatup\/article\/view\/35\/98":"With the European General Data Protection Regulation there will be a legal obligation for controllers to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment for the first time. This paper examines the new provisions in detail and examines ways for their implementation.

special topic of TATuP presents a collection of initial perspectives first indications and discussions on the topic of automated driving which has become an important subject of mobility research in recent years Even though there is still widespread public scepticism about its technical and organizational maturity many experts expect vehicles with high or full driving automation to be deployed in the foreseeable future But will road traffic automation be a blessing or a curse for future sustainable mobility concepts Technology Assessment is confronted with a dilemma that is not untypical for this discipline On the one hand in view of the many uncertainties possible implications of the new technology can so far only vaguely be described On the other hand the technology has considerable transformation potential so that a timely shaping of its development seems socially desirable","https:\/\/www.tatup.de\/index.php\/tatup\/article\/view\/133\/190":"Automated driving is currently viewed with great skepticism A disruptive strategy for the introduction of automated driving could therefore be met with a lack of acceptance To avoid this evolutionary strategies aim to create

sustainability of this strategy","https:\/\/www.tatup.de\/index.php\/tatup\/article\/view\/132\/192":"his study estimates the macroeconomic cost saving potentials that might be achieved through

an annual cost saving potential of 249 bill Euro at midlevel market penetration This corresponds to 08 of the German GDP in 2016 which is considerably high compared to the economic growth of 19 in the
